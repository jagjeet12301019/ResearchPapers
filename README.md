# ResearchPapers
OWL and Python code files for Semantic project
In this study, we are developing an application using Semantic technologies specifically an ontology for the “papers and corresponding datasets” available around Artificial Intelligence studies. In the future if deployed, we can enlarge the scope towards more areas like Space, Chemistry, Physics and many others. 
In this report we are going through different steps used to develop this basic Ontology and its implementation with a further scope to extend and deploy: 
Concept and Aim Section will cover the objective of application. Design section will describe how the ontology and RDF schema is created. Implementation section discusses the technology and tools used to develop the application and make it accessible with an interface. In Evaluation and Use Section we are explaining different SPARQL Queries and in Critical reflection we will be comparing with current available systems and how it can be expended in future.
